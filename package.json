  "description": "This project started out as a personal hobby looking for something to do with my friends during the covid-19 outbreak. I had gotten into playing a few card games with my friends and wanted to recreate something similar that we could play online and not have to meet each other inn person. I initally decided to recreate a game called red flags since it had fairly simple rules and I felt I could recreate it but I am definitely going to use everything I learned during this project to recreate other games in the future and expand upon it.",
